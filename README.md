# Hiveory

> Project intelligence lives in the project, not in a chat session.

Hiveory is a local-first, AI-native desktop dev environment. Run any CLI coding agent in a terminal pane; every agent reads and writes **one shared, project-scoped memory store**, so switching tools never loses context. Hand a goal to QueenBee and a team of agents builds it in parallel — each in its own git worktree, coordinated by file-ownership locks.

- **Shared memory (Nectar)** — hybrid vector + keyword retrieval over `.nectar/memory/*.md`, injected into every agent.
- **WorkerBees** — launch Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Aider, and more in real PTY panes.
- **QueenBee** — conversational planner that breaks a goal into tasks and dispatches agents via tool-calling.
- **Plane workspace** — one surface at a time: WorkerBees, Terminal, Browser, CoWorkers, or Android Emulator.
- **Browser + Emulator panes** — CDP localhost preview with agent-readable screenshots; build/boot Android AVDs.
- **Local voice** — whisper.cpp dictation, no API key, with in-app push-to-talk hotkeys.

## 🚀 How to Use

- **Open a project** — a `.nectar/` memory store is created (or reused) in the folder. Nectar MCP (`nectar_query`) is auto-registered into every MCP-capable WorkerBee CLI config (Claude `.mcp.json`, OpenCode, Codex, …) and pre-approved in Claude `settings.local.json`. Paths are normalized for Windows (no `\\?\` / `//?/` prefixes, which break Node). Claude workspace trust is pre-written to `~/.claude.json`. Files you open in Explorer/Search/Git are tracked for Nectar retrieval hints. Pick a **theme** from the title-bar palette (Hive default, Claude, Neon, Midnight, Forest, Rose, Slate, Dracula) — it recolors the full UI (chrome, panes, boards, terminals), not just the canvas.
- **Pick a plane** from the title bar, then use its `+` to add panes: launch a CLI agent (WorkerBees), a shell (Terminal), a CDP browser, or an Android emulator. WorkerBees resolve CLIs from `%APPDATA%\npm` (and native package bins like `opencode-ai/bin/opencode.exe`) even when the GUI process PATH is incomplete, and spawn with permission-bypass flags. MCP-capable CLIs get a local Nectar marker only — handoff transcripts are never pasted into the CLI prompt.
- **Dispatch with QueenBee** — describe a goal in the right dock; Steward breaks it into tasks with declared file ownership, creates a git worktree per builder, launches an agent in each, and tracks them on the Task Comb board.
- **Preview & test** — the Browser pane loads your localhost dev server; QueenBee can screenshot it. The Emulator pane builds an immutable AVD (device, RAM, storage) and boots it.
- **Voice** — click the mic in QueenBee to dictate; or push-to-talk: hold **Ctrl+Win** to type into the focused field, **Win+Alt** to dictate into QueenBee.

## 🧠 Implementation Overview

Each root folder is a standalone package that owns its domain; **Hive borrows, never re-implements**. Side effects that a browser can't do (git, fs, PTY) go through typed ports, with Tauri-backed adapters supplied by Hive.

    U[User] --> UI[React UI]
    UI -->|invoke| RS[Rust Backend]

```

- **Hybrid retrieval** — query is embedded as a deterministic 384-dim char n-gram (identical in Rust and JS), fused with SQLite FTS via Reciprocal Rank Fusion, then token-budget capped. See [`Nectar/src/search`](Nectar/src/search).
- **Orchestration** — `HiveMind.Orchestrator` runs file-ownership lock checks before dispatch and merges branches on approve. Pure core stays free of `node:` imports (enforced by a test); Hive injects adapters in [`hivemindAdapters.ts`](Hive/src/features/orchestration/hivemindAdapters.ts).

    PL -->|conflict| BLK[blocked card]
    BEE --> RV[review] --> MG[merge + release locks]
```

- **Pure card + AVD logic** — board ordering ([`TaskComb/src/cards.ts`](TaskComb/src/cards.ts)) and Android `config.ini` generation ([`Hive/src/features/emulator/android/avd.ts`](Hive/src/features/emulator/android/avd.ts)) are pure and unit-tested.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js ≥ 20
- pnpm ≥ 9 (`npm i -g pnpm`)
- Rust (stable) + Cargo — https://rustup.rs
- [Tauri v2 system dependencies](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites) for your OS
- At least one CLI coding agent on PATH (e.g. `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Optional: Android SDK (`emulator` + `platform-tools`) for the Emulator plane

Provider API keys are entered in the in-app Settings panel and stored locally — there are no `.env` files.

**Install & run**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm turbo build
cd Hive && pnpm tauri:dev
```

**Build installers**

```bash
cd Hive && pnpm tauri:build
```
